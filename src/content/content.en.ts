16:8 fasting is a simple and popular time-based approach to eating, where you fast for 16 hours and have an 8-hour window to eat each day. Known as the 16/8 method, it allows you to maintain regular meal patterns—simply delay your first meal until later in the day and finish eating earlier in the evening. This flexibility makes it one of the most accessible fasting strategies for beginners and experienced fasters alike.

Although its roots trace back to ancient religious and cultural practices, modern interest in time-restricted eating surged in the 2010s as researchers investigated its effects on weight management, metabolic health, and cellular repair. Today, numerous studies highlight how the 16/8 method can improve insulin sensitivity, boost fat burning, and support natural cellular cleanup processes (autophagy).

During the 16-hour fasting period, insulin levels drop, allowing your body to tap into stored fat for energy. Extended fasting windows also activate autophagy—your cells' way of clearing out damaged components and regenerating new, healthy structures. Additionally, fasting can modulate hunger and satiety hormones (ghrelin and leptin), helping regulate appetite and promote sustained energy levels.

Implementing the 16/8 method is as easy as skipping breakfast or moving it to mid-morning, then finishing your last meal by early evening. Many people find black coffee, tea, and water useful hunger-busters during the fasting period.
