    <p>Intermittent fasting has become one of the most popular health trends, and for good reason. The 16:8 method is particularly effective for beginners because it's sustainable and fits well into most lifestyles. To get started, you'll want to use a reliable <a href="/" class="text-yellow-400 hover:text-yellow-300 underline">free fasting timer</a> to track your fasting windows accurately.</p>
    
    <h2>What is 16:8 Intermittent Fasting?</h2>
    <p>The 16:8 method involves fasting for 16 hours and eating within an 8-hour window. This typically means skipping breakfast and eating between 12 PM and 8 PM, though you can adjust the timing to fit your schedule. Our <a href="/" class="text-yellow-400 hover:text-yellow-300 underline">fasting clock</a> makes it easy to visualize your progress and stay on track.</p>
    
    <h2>Benefits You Can Expect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Weight Loss:</strong> Natural calorie reduction and improved metabolism</li>
