**Intro**  
The 16/8 intermittent fasting method is one of the most popular fasting schedules because it's simple, beginner-friendly and easy to adapt. In this guide you'll learn what 16/8 is, its benefits, practical daily schedule, mistakes to avoid and a realistic 30-day plan.

## What is 16/8 intermittent fasting?
The 16/8 schedule means you fast for 16 hours each day and eat all your meals within an 8-hour window. The most common eating window is 12:00 PM to 8:00 PM, but you can shift it to fit your lifestyle (e.g., 10:00–18:00).

### How it works (short)
Fasting extends the time between meals so your insulin levels drop, enabling your body to burn stored fat more efficiently. You're not restricting calories (necessarily) — you're restricting the eating timeframe.

## Benefits of 16/8
- **Simplicity** — no counting calories, just limit time window.
- **Sustainable** — easy to fit with work and family life.
- **Metabolic improvements** — may reduce insulin resistance, help weight management.
- **Autophagy & recovery** — longer fasts encourage cellular repair processes (evidence is evolving).

## Common mistakes beginners make
### 1. Eating too many calories in the window
Time-restricted eating is not a license to overeat junk food. Prioritize protein, veggies, healthy fats.

### 2. Skipping hydration and electrolytes
During the fasting hours drink water, herbal tea or black coffee. For longer-term fasters, add electrolytes if needed.

### 3. Going too fast
If you're used to six small meals, start with 12/12 and gradually extend to 14/10 then 16/8.

## Example 16/8 daily routine
**08:00 AM – 12:00 PM:** Fasting period (water, coffee, tea allowed)  
**12:00 PM:** First meal (balanced, protein + healthy carbs)  
**04:00 PM:** Light snack or second small meal  
**07:30 PM:** Last meal of the day (nutrient-dense, avoid heavy sugar)  
**08:00 PM – 08:00 AM:** Fasting period resumes

## 30-day beginner plan (practical)
### Week 1: Ease in
- Days 1–3: 12/12 window. Focus on hydration.
- Days 4–7: 14/10 window. Add gentle walks.

### Week 2: Stabilize
- 16/8 for 4–5 days. Keep meals balanced and track energy levels.

### Week 3–4: Optimize
- Continue 16/8, add strength training twice a week, monitor sleep and stress.

## Meal tips
- Breakfast (when window opens): Omelette with greens + oats or greek yogurt with berries.
- Post-workout meal: Lean protein + veggies + complex carbs.
- Snacks: Nuts, cottage cheese, a piece of fruit.

## Who should avoid/seek medical advice
- Pregnant or breastfeeding women.
- People with Type 1 diabetes or on certain medications.
- Those with eating disorder history — consult a professional.

## FAQ (short)
**Q: Can I drink coffee during fasting?**  
A: Yes — black coffee, black tea, and water are fine. Avoid sugar and milk.

**Q: Will I lose muscle?**  
A: Not necessarily. Keep protein intake adequate and do resistance training.

**Q: How soon will I see results?**  
A: Some people notice reduced appetite and small weight loss in 2–4 weeks. Long-term changes take consistency.
