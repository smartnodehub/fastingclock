      <h1>16/8 Intermittent Fasting Schedule for Beginners</h1>
      <p>
        The 16/8 intermittent fasting method is one of the most popular fasting schedules in 2025. It’s simple, beginner-friendly, and easy to adapt to daily life. In this guide, we’ll walk through the basics of how to start, what to eat, and tips to succeed.
      </p>

      <h2>What Is the 16/8 Schedule?</h2>
      <p>
        The 16/8 schedule means you fast for 16 hours each day and eat all your meals within an 8-hour window. The most common eating window is 12:00 PM to 8:00 PM, but you can adjust it to fit your lifestyle.
      </p>

      <h2>Example Daily Routine</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>8:00 AM – 12:00 PM:</strong> Fasting period (water, coffee, tea allowed)</li>
        <li><strong>12:00 PM:</strong> First meal (balanced, protein + healthy carbs)</li>
        <li><strong>4:00 PM:</strong> Light snack or second small meal</li>
        <li><strong>7:30 PM:</strong> Last meal of the day (nutrient-dense, avoid heavy sugar)</li>
        <li><strong>8:00 PM – 8:00 AM:</strong> Fasting period resumes</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Tips for Success</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Start gradually – begin with 12-hour fasts and extend to 16 hours.</li>
        <li>Stay hydrated with water, tea, or black coffee.</li>
        <li>Focus on whole foods, lean proteins, and vegetables.</li>
        <li>Plan meals in advance to avoid overeating when the window opens.</li>
      </ul>
